# cure.health

Cure.Health is a mobile application that will help the user get precautions or remedies to cure diseases or daily health problems through simple homemade things or simple yoga. This application is a step toward your health.
<br>
Today, almost 90% of the plus population has mobile devices in their palms, and they are not paying attention to their health. Health problems are becoming more common than ever in the world today. This probably has to do with both progress in medical science, because of which it has been easy to diagnose health problems, and people’s lifestyle, which is becoming increasingly unhealthy. The principal causes of common health issues are an unhealthy diet, a lack of exercise, high stress, and genetics. Nowadays, no one has time to make appointments for diseases that they know can be cured with time, so they ignore them. <br>
In today’s era of smartphones and the internet reaching home to home, rural and far-flung areas are also reaping the benefits of healthcare apps. Instead of websites, mobile apps are trending. It is also time-saving. If you are a person who is health conscious and wants to keep yourself active and fit, this application is a good choice to use daily. Everyone can do that yoga and take precautions easily, at any time, in any place. You do not need special equipment and do not even have to change clothes. My wish with the app is to keep users' minds calm and balanced and to keep them healthy.<br>
In it, I have collected 40 yoga and homemade remedies through Ayurveda sequences tailored to specific diseases and problems, as well as all-around sequences using health websites.
You’ll find short sequences that you can perform any time of day. The yoga positions are also described in photos, and the Ayurvedic remedies are described in words. You just have to click on yoga or ayurveda and then choose the disease you want to cure, and you get your valuable information.<br><br>
# Software description<br>
We used Android Studio to make this app.  
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development. It is based on IntelliJ IDEA, a Java-integrated development environment for software, and incorporates its code.
To support application development within the Android operating system, the Android Studio uses a Gradle-based build system and emulator.
Every project in the Android Studio has one or more modalities with source code and resource files. These modalities include Android app modules, library modules, and Google app engine modules.
By default, Android Studio displays your project files in the Android project view. Modalities organize this view to provide quick access to your project’s key source files.
